# Measles-detection
A deep learning model to classify measles skin lesions

The deep learning model was tuned, and the parameters were saved.
You can assess the tuned model using: 
``model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model paras.ckpt'))``

Our measles detection tool can be using either using the link ""Measles detection web link"" or scan the QR code ""Measles detection QR code.png""
